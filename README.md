# Development of seamless algorithm and robust to vignetting artifact in histological images obtained from whole slide imaging technique
Whole slide imaging (WSI) refers to the process of creating a high-resolution digital image
of a whole slide. Since digital images are typically produced by stitching image sequences acquired
from different fields of view, the visual quality of the images can be degraded owing to shading
distortion, which produces black plaid patterns on the images.
